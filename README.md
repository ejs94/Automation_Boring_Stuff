# Automation Boring Stuff with Python

I had already read the book, but I had not delved into practice. For anyone interested in learning Python it is a very interesting book to try. But if you already have some knowledge I suggest skipping straight to chapter 7 and go after what interests you.

The Udemy course is a shortcut for anyone who is in a hurry or needs audio visual learning. Or even just to practice with the author's comments. I recommend.

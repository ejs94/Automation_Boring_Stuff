# Automation Boring Stuff with Python

I particularly like this book a lot, and I ended up returning to it more than once. This repository will contain some exercises that are covered in the book but revised for the course that the author created within the udemy platform. For anyone interested in learning Python it is a very interesting book to try. But if you already have some knowledge I suggest skipping straight to chapter 7 and go after what interests you.

The Udemy course is a shortcut for anyone who is in a hurry or needs audio visual learning. Or even just to practice with the author's comments. I recommend.
